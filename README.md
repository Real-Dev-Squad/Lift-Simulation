# Lift-Simulation
Create a web app where you can simulate lift mechanics for a client

# UI Example
![Lift Simulation Example](Lift-Simulation-Example.png "Lift Simulation Example")

# Requirements
  1. Have a page where you input the number of floors and lifts from the user
  2. An interactive UI is generated, where we have visual depictions of lifts and buttons on floors
  3. Upon clicking a particular button on the floor, a lift goes to that floor

  Milestone 1:
   - Data store that contains the state of your application data
   - JS Engine that is the controller for which lift goes where
   - Dumb UI that responds to controller's commands
   
  Milestone 2:
   - Lift having doors open in 2.5s, then closing in another 2.5s
   - Lift moving at 2s per floor
   - Lift stopping at every floor where it was called
   - Mobile friendly design
